# Building BioEngine Apps

We use BioEngine, a tailored version of [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io) to run models applications. Therefore, you can basically run ImJoy plugins with the BioEngine specific api. 

Depending on different types of application, for web application, please refer to [here](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-core#use-your-web-application-inside-imjoy) for integrating the `imjoy-rpc` with your web app. Once done you can simply set `source` in the [`Resource Description File`](/bioimageio_rdf_spec) to your web app url.


For Jupyter notebooks and other types, you will need to build a new ImJoy plugin.

By default it loads also a [Jupyter Engine](https://github.com/imjoy-team/jupyter-engine-manager) which uses free computational resources on MyBinder.org, so you can also run small models in Python. 

For example, this is a basic ImJoy plugin in Python, that works with the BioEngine:

```python
from imjoy import api

class ImJoyPlugin():
    def setup(self):
        pass

    def run(self, ctx):
        # when the app is triggered from a model/dataset/notebook etc.
        # you will receive the current item via `ctx.data`
        if ctx.config.mode == 'one':
            model = ctx.data
            assert model.type == 'model'
            api.alert("Running app from model: " + model['name'])

        # when the app is triggered from the app card it self
        # you will receive all the resource items via `ctx.data`
        elif ctx.config.mode == 'all':
            all_items = ctx.data
            # filter the models based on type
            models = filter(lambda it: it['type'] == 'model', all_items)
            api.alert("Number of models: " + str(len(models)))

api.export(ImJoyPlugin())
```

For other types of plugins (e.g. in Javascript), the same `ctx` object will be passed into the plugin.

You can do the debugging inside [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io), for more information, please consult https://imjoy.io/docs.

To test with the BioEngine, you can go to https://modelhub.riscale.eu, on the menu located in the top-right corner, you can load a local ImJoy plugin file to run it with the BioEngine. One additional feature is that the BioEngine will keep track of the local file, if you made new changes with your code editor (e.g. vim, vscode) the engine will try to reload the plugin file. 

TIP: if your imjoy plugin is designed for not only work with bioimage.io but also other purposes, you can use an `if` statement to check `ctx.config.type == 'bioengine'`.

## Make a standalone web app compatible with ImJoy/BioEngine

Making an ImJoy plugin is not the only way to support the BioEngine, if you have already a web application or website, you can easily load a `imjoy-rpc` js file to your website and expose api for ImJoy/BioEngine.

See [here](https://github.com/imjoy-team/ImJoy-core#use-your-web-application-inside-imjoy) for more details.

For example, [Kaibu](https://kaibu.org) is a standlone web app that compatible with the BioEngine. Because it [loads the imjoy-rpc library](https://github.com/imjoy-team/kaibu/blob/efd355eff95da9aa0f7eb97103585b753063c05d/public/index.html#L45) and [exposed api functions for ImJoy](https://github.com/imjoy-team/kaibu/blob/master/src/imjoyAPI.js).

## How to submit BioEngine Apps to the website?

If you are one of our [community partners](https://blob/master/docs/join-partners.md), you can add the app url to your model repository. Otherwise, please submit your BioEngine Apps to RI-SCALE Model Hub by posting the url [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/issues/26).
