# Getting Started

## RI-SCALE Model Hub: Advanced AI models in one-click
The RI-SCALE Model Hub is a community-driven AI model repository. The aim is to facilitate the adoption of AI methods across research infrastructures by providing easy access to pretrained AI models. By establishing a common Model Resource Description File Specification, the model hub serves as a distribution point for deep learning models trained to perform scientific data analysis tasks.

Several founding partners including ilastik, ImJoy, Fiji, deepImageJ and ZeroCostDL4Mic are involved in the creation of the model hub and we welcome more community partners to join the efforts. Our vision is to define a common standard which would allow all models in the model hub to be compatible with community partner tools. Such compatibility will ensure that the models in the model hub can be interoperable between different tools and truly be used by non-computational scientists through user-friendly interfaces. 

In addition to the Model Resource Description File Specification, we aim to make cutting-edge AI technology accessible to our users by providing detailed model descriptions, tagging, searching and automatic testing of all submitted models. Models can be directly executed from the site with users' own data samples, and linked to their training data and Jupyter/Colab Notebooks.

The model hub is open for contributions from the community partners and external individuals. You are welcome to submit models to the model zoo. We will do our best to ensure you have a smooth experience contributing your work which will of course remain in your IP with all necessary attributions.

## How to participate in the RI-SCALE Model Hub
Participation into the RI-SCALE Model Hub is opened to many different profiles. None of them exclude any other. Here are the options in which you can intereact with the RI-SCALE Model Hub:

### As a User or Consumer of models, applications or datasets
Act as a user in the RI-SCALE Model Hub refers to an individual or user who engages with the project by utilizing the pre-existing models available on [RI-SCALE Model Hub](http://modelhub.riscale.eu/). Their primary role involves downloading these models and incorporating them into their workflow using compatible software or any specific manner that suits their needs. For example, a Life Scientist can be considered a consumer by accessing the [website](http://modelhub.riscale.eu), selecting a Deep Learning model relevant to their research, and integrating it into their preferred software, such as deepImageJ or other compatible platforms. As a consumer, their focus lies in leveraging the existing models to enhance their data analysis tasks, thereby benefiting from the diverse range of models provided by the RI-SCALE Model Hub.

### As a Contributor or developer of models, applications or datasets
A contributor or developer can either be an individual person or a group, entity, or software. As an individual contributor, your primary objective is to actively contribute to the project by uploading models to RI-SCALE Model Hub. By doing so, you expand the range of available models, enriching the repository and fostering the growth of the scientific research community. As a contributor, you play a crucial role in sharing your expertise and innovative models with the broader community, contributing to advancements in scientific data analysis. Similarly, a software contributor refers to a software application or system that actively participates in the project by uploading models to [modelhub.riscale.eu](http://modelhub.riscale.eu). These software contributors enhance the available models by providing new and diverse solutions, further expanding the capabilities of the RI-SCALE Model Hub. Whether you contribute as an individual or a software entity, your active involvement in uploading models to [modelhub.riscale.eu](http://modelhub.riscale.eu) is instrumental in supporting the project's objectives. By sharing your models, you contribute to the collective knowledge and empower researchers across scientific domains.

### As a Community Partner
Usually, a community partner is an organization, a company, a research group, or a software team (of one or more) that can consume and/or produce resources of the RI-SCALE Model Hub. Additionally, most partners continuously and openly contribute resources of their own. The founders community partners represent open source consumer software of [RI-SCALE Model Hub](RI-SCALE Model Hub/) (e.g. [ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org), [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/), [deepImageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io), [ZeroCostDL4Mic](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic), [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist)). A Community Partner can either be a team behind a software which produces or consumes trained models compatible with the [RI-SCALE Model Hub](http://modelhub.riscale.eu/) spec or an organization, group, company or team (of one or more) who contributed and will keep contributing more models to RI-SCALE Model Hub.
