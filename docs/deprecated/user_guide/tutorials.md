## Consumer-software guidelines

### DeepImageJ

**Note: deepImageJ supports PyTorch and Tensorflow 1 models**

1. Install the [deepImageJ plugin](https://deepimagej.github.io/download.html) in ImageJ.
This will give you all the necessary Plugins to run bioimage.io models at the moment.

2. Install a model from the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io/):
      1) Download a deepImageJ model from the BioImage Model Zoo repository.
      2) Use `DeepImageJ Install Model` in ImageJ to install the `.zip` file that you just downloaded: choose the `Private model` option and `From ZIP file`.
      3) In the `zip` file you just downloaded, there is an `exampleImage.tif`that you can open in ImageJ and process with the model you just downloaded.
      4) See a detailed tutorial [here](https://deepimagej.github.io/deepimagej/tutorials.html).      


### Fiji
**Note: Fiji only supports Tensorflow 1 models at the moment!**

1. Install the [CSBDeep-Plugin](https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/CSBDeep-in-Fiji-%E2%80%93-Installation) in Fiji.
This will give you all the necessary Plugins to run bioimage.io models at the moment.
2. Open the image you want to run the model on
3. a) If your model is a [CSBDeep](https://imagej.net/CSBDeep) one, go to Plugins > CSBDeep and choose either "N2V", "DenoiSeg" or "Run your network"(default)
   
   b) For any other bioimage.io model, go to Plugins > bioimage.io > bioimage.io prediction. 
4.  Continuing from 3b) you will arrive at this window:

The configuration fields should be self-explanatory.

5. Click "OK" to run the model prediction.

### ZeroCostDL4Mic
**Note: [ZeroCostDL4Mic](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki) allows you trainig models and upload them to the BioImage Model Zoo or fine-tune existing ones!**

1. Download a ZeroCostDL4Mic model from the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io/) repository. 
2. Unzip the model `.zip` file so you can use it later in the notebook.
3. Open the ZeroCostDL4Mic notebook that corresponds to the model you downloaded. 
4. When required, specify the path to the unziped folder containing the model.
