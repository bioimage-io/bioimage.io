# User Analytics

We provide the analytics service to help consumer software to keep track of their resource (including model, datasets etc.) downloads.

### Report resource downloads

To help us maintain the resource download statistics at BioImage.IO, please send a report to our analytics service when a resource item is downloaded.

Under the hood, we use [matomo](https://matomo.org) to track the user downloads. It provide tracking api in various programming languages and frameworks, see here: https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/tracking-api.

The easiest way to report a model download is to send an http request to matomo.


You need to construct an URL to report the download:

`https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/matomo.php?download=https://doi.org/[MODEL DOI]&idsite=1&rec=1&r=646242&h=13&m=35&s=20&url=http://bioimage.io/#/?id=[MODEL DOI]&uadata={"brands":[{"brand":"[CONSUMER ID]","version":"[CONSUMER VERSION]"}]}`


In the above URL, you need to provide the following parameters:
 * `[MODEL DOI]`: The resource doi, it should be similar to `10.5281/zenodo.55555555`. Also note that Zenodo deposit has concept doi and version doi, we recommend to use the concept doi such that the downloads across versions can be aggregated.
 * `[CONSUMER ID]`: The id for the registered consumer software, for example: `ilastik` or `deepimagej`.
 * `[CONSUMER VERSION]`: The software version for the consumer software.


### Obtain resource usage statistics
You can get the user statistics from via the HTTP API, for example:
 * To get the global statistics of the whole website: `https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/?module=API&method=Live.getCounters&idSite=1&lastMinutes=30&format=JSON&token_auth=anonymous`
 * To get the number of downloads: `https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/?module=API&method=Actions.getDownloads&idSite=1&period=year&date=2023-03-01&format=JSON&token_auth=anonymous`
 * To get the number of downloads for a specific resource (via DOI): ```https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/?module=API&method=Actions.getDownload&downloadUrl=https://doi.org/`[MODEL DOI]`&idSite=1&period=year&date=2023-03-01&format=JSON&token_auth=anonymous```. To see an example, click here: https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/?module=API&method=Actions.getDownload&downloadUrl=https://doi.org/test&idSite=1&idCustomReport=1&period=year&date=2023-03-01&format=JSON&token_auth=anonymous

 For more detailed API, see here: https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/reporting-api

 
Please note that the reports are not processed in realtime, this means you won't see the statistics for your reports immediately:
 - In the report request, we need to configure the date properly. For example, we can change period to `year` and date to `2023-03-01` (see here: https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/Piwik/Period)
 - The report will only be generated every 15 minutes: https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_41/ so we won't see the report immediately.
