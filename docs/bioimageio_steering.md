The RI-SCALE Model Hub and the corresponding model metadata specification has been established by the authors of [the reference paper](https://modelhub.riscale.eu/docs/#/?id=reference-publication). The project continues to be under active development; community partners meet weekly to discuss immediate issues, short-, medium- and long-term plans. Decisions on community partner memberships, changes to the model specifications or website design and developments are made in the weekly meeting if at least 5 (five) participants are present. All decisions are made public in the meeting minutes [currently hosted here](https://github.com/ri-scale/model-hub/issues/28) and take effect after 15 days unless other members raise concerns at the next weekly meetings. The Steering Board of the RI-SCALE project [listed here](https://www.riscale.eu/) maintains veto power on all decisions, including changes to the above-described procedure.
