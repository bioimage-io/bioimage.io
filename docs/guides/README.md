## Developers Guide

### Models in the RI-SCALE Model Hub
A RI-SCALE Model Hub model is a zip file containing all the items, technical description and metadata of the model, together with the trained architecture of the model. Briefly, a RI-SCALE Model Hub model has at least, the following items:
* Trained model in the correct format (check the Resource Description File Specifications for the [supported formats](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/model_descr_latest.md))
* Example input image (numpy array)
* Example output (numpy array)
* Resource description file specifications (`rdf.yaml`)
* An example cover image for visual representation of the model in the zoo.

In some cases, the model may need additional files.

#### Model contribution requirements

- Follow the [RI-SCALE Model Hub Model Resource Description File Specification (RDF)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/model_descr_latest.md) with `format_version>= 0.4.5`. 
- The model is expected to be cross-compatible among the consumer software, and should always run on at least one.
- The model should be well documented (i.e., human readable name and rich description tailored for life-scientists, citations)
- The model should be public and can be used by anyone under the chosen licensing conditions.

#### Upload a model to the RI-SCALE Model Hub

**1. Create a RI-SCALE Model Hub model** 
Two options:
   1. Choose one way to create your model:
      - Automatic export of the model using the [bioimageio.core python library](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) (recomended).
        Example code [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/example/model_creation.ipynb).
          - The main function to build the model is `bioimageio.core.build_model`. Check its input variables to know what has to be provided.
      - Manual generation of the model:
         - Create the [RI-SCALE Model Hub Model Resource Description File Specifications](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/model_descr_latest.md) (`rdf.yaml` file).
         - Each field on the file is either mandatory or optional. In the Bioimage Model Zoo web page you can find different examples. 
   2. Check that the model is correctly created:
      - Static validation of the model format using the [bioimageio.core python library](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) library (*e.g.*, in the terminal, `bioimageio validate /../rdf.yaml`).
      - Dynamic validation of the model's deployment (*e.g.*, in the terminal, `bioimageio test-model --weights tensorflow_saved_model_bundle --device cpu /.../rdf.yaml`). It tests that the model generates the expected output.
      
**2. Upload the model to the RI-SCALE Model Hub**

To upload a model to the RI-SCALE Model Hub, you have a tutorial video of the process step by step available [here](https://oc.embl.de/index.php/s/JBWwJGgsXh0vYM6).
         
<img src="./guides/contribute_model.png" align="center" width="1000"/>

For a detailed explanation, follow these steps:
1. In [RI-SCALE Model Hub](https://modelhub.riscale.eu/), click on `+Upload` and follow the steps:
        
2. Log in to Zenodo and give access to the BioEngine application. You will see an automatic message once you are logged in. If not, refresh the page. This step needs to be done only for the first time you upload a model. 

3. Upload your model RDF. 
<img src="./guides/upload_1.png" align="center" width="500"/>

4. Complete the missing fields.
<img src="./guides/upload_2.png" align="center" width="500"/>
        
<img src="./guides/upload_3.png" align="center" width="500"/>
    
5. A [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/pulls/bioimageiobot) is generated (this process may take some minutes). In the PR, the model is tested by a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for its technical correctness. and reviewed by a maintainer from the RI-SCALE Model Hub team. This PR is aimed for further discussions between model contributors and the RI-SCALE Model Hub team.

6. Once the model passes all checks and has the approval of a maintainer, it will be added to the RI-SCALE Model Hub collection and displayed in the webpage (this process may take some minutes). 

#### Upload a model through Zenodo
**Note:** This tutorial provides a temporary solution for uploading models to the RI-SCALE Model Hub via Zenodo while the upload feature on the RI-SCALE Model Hub website is being fixed.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of uploading a model to the RI-SCALE Model Hub community on Zenodo. The RI-SCALE Model Hub project aims to collect and share AI models for scientific data analysis, and your contribution is valuable. Follow the steps below to upload your model.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the Zenodo website at [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org). You need to create a Zenodo account if you do not have one. 
   <!-- ![Zenodo initial page](contribute_models/zenodo_upload_01.png) -->
   <img src="./guides/zenodo_upload_01.png" alt="Zenodo initial page" align="center" width="1000"/>
   
2. On the right, close to your username, click the "New upload" button to begin the model upload process. Make sure that the repository is set as public. 
The files in the RI-SCALE Model Hub zip have to be uploaded one-by-one (See the example in the image below). Note that you can drag & drop all together at once.
   <!-- ![New upload](contribute_models/zenodo_upload_04.png) -->
   <img src="./guides/zenodo_upload_04.png" alt="New upload" align="center" width="1000"/>

3. Add `modelhub.riscale.eu` on Keywords and subjects. This is crucial for us to identify your submission.
   <!-- ![Find RI-SCALE Model Hub community](contribute_models/zenodo_upload_03.png) -->
   <img src="./guides/zenodo_upload_03.png" alt="Find RI-SCALE Model Hub community" align="center" width="1000"/>
   
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the required information about your model. Make sure to include a clear description, relevant tags, and any necessary documentation.

5. Once finished, click on Submit.
   
6. Your model will be proposed as a new contribution to the RI-SCALE Model Hub automatically. If the model passes all the tests, it will be automatically displayed in the Zoo. If the model does not pass the test, the GitHub users indicated in `maintainers` in the `rdf.yaml` file will be noitified through GitHub. This process can take 12-24h.

You've successfully uploaded your model to the RI-SCALE Model Hub community on Zenodo. Thank you for your contribution to the RI-SCALE Model Hub project. Remember that this is a temporary solution while the upload feature on the RI-SCALE Model Hub website is being fixed. We appreciate your patience and support!


####  Model Documentation
##### Model naming

Models are expected to be used by life-scientists, thus, it is expected that the naming is human readable but also informative enough regarding the final application and the biological tissue being analysed. Example:
   
   **Name:** `Neuron Segmentation in EM (Membrane Prediction)`, `B. Sutilist bacteria segmentation - Widefield microscopy - 2D UNet`

   
##### Model Tags
The tags in the model RDF are used to search for each model in the RI-SCALE Model Hub. The more informative tags you write, the easier it will be for a potential user to find your model. Example:

   **My model description**: An encoder-decoder trained for denoising of point-scanning super-resolution microsocpy images of HeLa cells microtubules
   
   **Tags**: `denoising`, `PSSR`, `microtubules`, `encoder-decoder`, `deblurring`, `fluorescence`, `2D`, `HeLa cells`, `deepimagej`, `ilastik`, `image restoration`, `trained-model` etc.

##### Model links
The RI-SCALE Model Hub is a software webpage. Each model is displayed with an interactive card that can have datasets, notebooks, applications, consumer-software or test-run buttons linked. Example:
    
   **Links**: `imjoy/BioImageIO-Packager`, `ilastik/ilastik`, `deepimagej/deepimagej`, `zero/dataset_fnet_3d_zerocostdl4mic` etc.

##### Representative Covers

You can include different cover images that represent the analysed tissue, imaging modality, image processing task and the performance of the model. This image will be used in the model card to guide the users through the model search.


#### Considerations for the model description file

When following the RI-SCALE Model Hub model RDF specification provided at https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io, it is important that you pay special attention to the following:
* Choose test input image(s) and generate the respective test output tensor(s). This enables our scripts to test your model for technical correctness and to test which [consumer software](https://modelhub.riscale.eu/docs/#/consumer_software/model_runner) can process it.
* Pre-processing and post-processing should be always described. You can check which [preprocessing](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/preprocessing_spec_latest.md) and [postprocessing](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/postprocessing_spec_latest.md) functions are supported at the moment and open an [issue here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/issues) if you are missing a specific operation. 
* Do not forget to include any additional files needed for the correct execution of the model during the upload process.

#### Model Resource Description File Specification (0.4.9)
This specification defines the fields used in a RI-SCALE Model Hub-compliant resource description file (`RDF`) for describing AI models with pretrained weights.
These fields are typically stored in YAML files which we call Model Resource Description Files or `model RDF`.
The model RDFs can be downloaded or uploaded to the modelhub.riscale.eu website, produced or consumed by RI-SCALE Model Hub-compatible consumers(e.g. image analysis software or other website).

The model RDF YAML file contains mandatory and optional fields. In the following description, optional fields are indicated by _optional_.
_optional*_ with an asterisk indicates the field is optional depending on the value in another field.

* <a id="format_version"></a>`format_version` _(required String)_ Version of the RI-SCALE Model Hub Model Resource Description File Specification used.
    This is mandatory, and important for the consumer software to verify before parsing the fields.
    The recommended behavior for the implementation is to keep backward compatibility and throw an error if the model yaml
    is in an unsupported format version. The current format version described here is

* <a id="config"></a>`config` _(optional YamlDict→Dict\[Any, Any\])_ A custom configuration field that can contain any keys not present in the RDF spec. This means you should not store, for example, github repo URL in `config` since we already have the `git_repo` key defined in the spec.
    Keys in `config` may be very specific to a tool or consumer software. To avoid conflicted definitions, it is recommended to wrap configuration into a sub-field named with the specific domain or tool name, for example:
    
    ```yaml
       config:
          bioimage_io:  # here is the domain name
            my_custom_key: 3837283
            another_key:
               nested: value
          imagej:
            macro_dir: /path/to/macro/file
    ```
    If possible, please use [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) for keys in `config`.
    For example:
    ```yaml

### Other contributions
You are welcome to submit your **models**, **datasest**, **applicaitons** and Jupyter **notebooks** to RI-SCALE Model Hub.

To add an resource item to RI-SCALE Model Hub, you need to provide a set of basic information about the resouce, including name, description, authors etc. and we will generate a resource card to display in the website.

For Community Partners, you can add models directly to the linked repository. If you are not part of the community partners, you can follow the instructions below to submit resource items (models, datasets etc.) to RI-SCALE Model Hub.

#### Submit to RI-SCALE Model Hub
* Step 1, prepare a [`Resource Description File`](/bioimageio_rdf_spec)(RDF) and complete at least the mandatory fields and ideally also the recommended fields for different types of resource.

* Step 2, save the RDF file in one of the public git hosting website, it is recommended to store the RDF file in your project git repository on Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket (make sure it's a public repo). Alternatively, you can post it on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), copy the the **raw** url to the actual file content.

* Step 3, post the url to the comment box below (if you don't see it, click [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/issues/26)). And the admin team will check and verify the format and incooperate to RI-SCALE Model Hub if the submitted file is qualified.

## Community Partners Guide
RI-SCALE Model Hub is a community-driven open source initiative, providing access to trained deep learning models and related resources contributed by the community members. To help us better disseminate and maintain the resources, we introduced the concepts of **community partner**. 

### Introduction to Community Partners

#### What is a community partner?
Usually, a community partner is an organization, a company, a research group, or a software team (of one or more) that can consume and/or produce resources of the RI-SCALE model hub. Additionally, most partners continuously and openly contribute resources of their own. The first community partners represent open source consumer software of RI-SCALE Model Hub (e.g. ilastik, Fiji, deepImageJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, StarDist).

#### Benefits as a community partner
By joining RI-SCALE Model Hub as a community partner, you will be able to:
 - Participate in decision making process of the model specification.
 - Show your logo in RI-SCALE Model Hub and enable filtering models by compatibility with your software.
 - Connect CI to automatically test new model compatibility with your software and use other infrastructure features provided by RI-SCALE Model Hub.
 
#### Responsibilities
The main responsibilities of a community partner are:
 - Use RI-SCALE Model Hub as their only primary trained model repository.
 - Review resources contributed by others that claim to be compatible with this community partner software.
 - Maintain this community partner's models and other resources in their linked repository, setup continous integration workflows to test models and keep them up-to-date with the latest spec.
 
#### Who should join as a community partner?
 * A team behind a software which produces or consumes trained models compatible with the RI-SCALE Model Hub spec.
 * A organization, group, company or team (of one or more) who contributed and will keep contributing more models to RI-SCALE Model Hub.

#### How does it work?
Community partners can host their own Github repository for storing models and other resources that are relevant. These resources are listed in a [collection RDF](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/collection_spec_latest.md)–a yaml file–which will be dynamically linked to the [central repository of RI-SCALE Model Hub](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models). The [continuous integration (CI) service](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/actions) configured in the central repo will then pull the resources from partners' repo and compile them into items displayed in the RI-SCALE Model Hub website. Each community partner is responsible for maintaining the resources that are relevant.

### How to join as a community partner?

Note that in order to contribute resources to the RI-SCALE Model Hub you do not need to become a community partner. How to contribute resources is described [here](/contribute_models/README.md). The role of a community partner is described [here](/community_partners/README.md).


If you are eligible and willing to join as a community partner, please submit a request issue [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection/issues/new) with relevant information including the following:
1. Description of your software, organization, company or team.
2. Description of the resources that you plan to contribute. Please also include the url to your project repo.
3. Description of future plans on how your project will be maintained.

The admin team of RI-SCALE Model Hub will discuss the request and decide whether to approve or decline. We will mainly check whether the project are beneficial for the users of RI-SCALE Model Hub and the requirements for participation are met.

Upon approval, we will guide you to follow these steps in order to incorporate your contribution to RI-SCALE Model Hub:

1. Firstly, please create or choose a GitHub repo for hosting your resource collection that you would like to contribute. We recommend to create a dedicated repository in your organization for this purpose. As an example you might want to take a look at the [ilastik collection](https://github.com/ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/blob/main/collection.yaml).
1. Add a [collection RDF](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/collection_spec_latest.md) in your chosen repository, which lists all resources you would like to contribute. For this, you will also need to prepare the icons of your software or project.
1. Setup CI service for testing your collection RDF. Please refer to [how to setup CI service](/community_partners/how_to_join?id=how-to-setup-ci-service-for-a-community-partners39-repo).
1. Make a PR (or an issue) in the RI-SCALE Model Hub Collection repo to link your collection to the [collection_rdf_template.yaml](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/main/collection_rdf_template.yaml)(under `config.partners`). We only require the link to your collection RDF here and need to agree on a partner id for you.
1. To make the maintainance easier, we also ask you to add one of the admin member as collabrators in your resource collection repository. This will make it easier for us to help you maintaining your collection, and keep synchronized in case we make changes to the specification.

### How to register a software or application?

A community partner can have one or multiple associated software, you can register them in the collection RDF file of your repository (see the previous section about creating a collection repository). A software is categorized as "Application" in the RI-SCALE Model Hub. The first thing to do is to create an application file in the [ImJoy plugin file format](https://imjoy.io/docs/#/development?id=plugin-file-format). This basically allows you define a landing page for your software with executable features such as download or test run buttons for your software. The most common use case is to create a landing page for your software. Each software will have an unique id, typically in the format of `<community partner id>/<software name>`. Every model can add links (manually when upload or automatically via the CI) to the software. For each model, the user can click the link on top of the model card, and the landing page will be loaded. Through the ImJoy plugin mechanism, the context information contains the current model information will be injected to the landing page, it's up to the developer who made the software app to decided how to use those information.

To see an example, you can find the [source for the ilastik app](https://github.com/ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/blob/main/src/ilastik-app.imjoy.html) and also the corresponding entry in the collection file [here](https://github.com/ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/blob/2d2f1b12b185b1b880bfb679ed2aa981bf88d1ed/collection.yaml#L45-L59).

### How to setup CI service for a community partners' repo?

The CI service is an useful tool to autotomize the maintenance of the model repo and ensure a high quality for all RI-SCALE Model Hub resources. 
You basically need to add some testing scripts to your repo and  configure it using CI services such as Github Actions,  Travis or Circle CI etc. The testing script will be triggered by a new commit or pull request to the repo. For simplicity, we recommend Github Actions which can be triggered by adding a yaml file under the folder `.github/workflows`. For example, here is an example file [.github/workflows/compile-manifest.yml](https://github.com/deepimagej/models/blob/master/.github/workflows/compile-manifest.yml) that we used to verify the model spec in the central repo.

There are at least three steps are recommended:
 1. Run the [`compile_model_manifest.py`](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/blob/master/manifest.modelhub.riscale.eu.yaml) script to make sure the manifest can be correctly compiled.
 2. Verify the yaml files according to model spec with [.github.com/bioimage-io/python-bioimage-io](https://github.com/bioimage-io/python-bioimage-io).
 3. If possible, test every models added to the repo.

As a start, you can use [.github/workflows/compile-manifest.yml](https://github.com/deepimagej/models/blob/master/.github/workflows/compile-manifest.yml) as your template.

See more information here: https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io#contribute-resource-test-summaries

### Report User Analytics

We provide the analytics service to help consumer software to keep track of their resource (including model, datasets etc.) downloads.

#### Report resource downloads

To help us maintain the resource download statistics at RI-SCALE Model Hub, please send a report to our analytics service when a resource item is downloaded.

Under the hood, we use [matomo](https://matomo.org) to track the user downloads. It provide tracking api in various programming languages and frameworks, see here: https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/tracking-api.

The easiest way to report a model download is to send an http request to matomo.


You need to construct an URL to report the download:

`https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/matomo.php?download=https://doi.org/[MODEL DOI]&idsite=1&rec=1&r=646242&h=13&m=35&s=20&url=http://modelhub.riscale.eu/#/?id=[MODEL DOI]&uadata={"brands":[{"brand":"[CONSUMER ID]","version":"[CONSUMER VERSION]"}]}`


In the above URL, you need to provide the following parameters:
 * `[MODEL DOI]`: The resource doi, it should be similar to `10.5281/zenodo.55555555`. Also note that Zenodo deposit has concept doi and version doi, we recommend to use the concept doi such that the downloads across versions can be aggregated.
 * `[CONSUMER ID]`: The id for the registered consumer software, for example: `ilastik` or `deepimagej`.
 * `[CONSUMER VERSION]`: The software version for the consumer software.


#### Obtain resource usage statistics
You can get the user statistics from via the HTTP API, for example:
 * To get the global statistics of the whole website: `https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/?module=API&method=Live.getCounters&idSite=1&lastMinutes=30&format=JSON&token_auth=anonymous`
 * To get the number of downloads: `https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/?module=API&method=Actions.getDownloads&idSite=1&period=year&date=2023-03-01&format=JSON&token_auth=anonymous`
 * To get the number of downloads for a specific resource (via DOI): ```https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/?module=API&method=Actions.getDownload&downloadUrl=https://doi.org/`[MODEL DOI]`&idSite=1&period=year&date=2023-03-01&format=JSON&token_auth=anonymous```. To see an example, click here: https://bioimage.matomo.cloud/?module=API&method=Actions.getDownload&downloadUrl=https://doi.org/test&idSite=1&idCustomReport=1&period=year&date=2023-03-01&format=JSON&token_auth=anonymous

 For more detailed API, see here: https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/reporting-api

 
Please note that the reports are not processed in realtime, this means you won't see the statistics for your reports immediately:
 - In the report request, we need to configure the date properly. For example, we can change period to `year` and date to `2023-03-01` (see here: https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/Piwik/Period)
 - The report will only be generated every 15 minutes: https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_41/ so we won't see the report immediately.

### RI-SCALE Model Hub Partner Collection

A RI-SCALE Model Hub partner collection is a YAML file in GitHub repository of a community partner. The file adheres to the collection RDF specification described [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io#collection-resource-description-file-specification).

The appearance of the partner collection on the website can be customized by the `config` field as described in the next section.  

#### Customizing appearance on modelhub.riscale.eu

Like any RDF, a collection RDF may have a `config` field to hold non-standardized metadata. We currently use some of this metadata to customize the partner collection appearance on the modelhub.riscale.eu website. The fields used here are subject to change, but as a community partner we'll keep you in the loop on any changes here and will likely formalize this part in the future.

A typical partner collection RDF `config` field may look like this:

```yaml
config:
  # a url for the user to get more details about the collection or your project
  # it can be a markdown file (*.md) hosted on github, you need to use the `raw` url
  # or an external link to your website
  about_url: http://details_about_my_collection

  # these tags will be used to filter items when the user select this collection
  tags:
    - awesome

### How to contribute tests summaries

As RI-SCALE Model Hub community partner may contribute test summaries. As defined in [bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/d435fcdb38c8b2152ac0d20f61ee498d88e7f1d0/bioimageio/core/common.py#L4) a test summary is a dictionary with the following keys:
 - name: str
 - source_name: str
 - status: Literal["passed", "failed"]
 - error: Union[None, str]
 - traceback: Optional[List[str]]
 - nested_errors: Optional[Dict[str, dict]]
 - bioimageio_spec_version: str
 - bioimageio_core_version: str
 - warnings: dict

In the [RI-SCALE Model Hub collection template](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/main/collection_rdf_template.yaml), where a community partner is registered, the location of `test_summaries` and how to trigger them can be specified as well.
The location of partner test summaries is specified by a GitHub repository `repository`, where test summaries are hosted in `deploy_branch`/`deploy_folder`.
To update the test summaries (for new or updated resources) `workflow` specifies a GitHub Actions workflow to trigger from `workflow_ref` by @bioimageiobot. 
For the automatic trigger machanism to work the partner `repository` needs to invite @bioimageiobot as a collaborator and the `workflow` needs to run on `workflow_dispatch` with a `pending_matrix` input.

Let's take a look at an example: the [ilastik partner entry](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/aa4742d33394809e44e63ce48f9bac9ad3518122/collection_rdf_template.yaml#L63-L68
) below specifies that test summaries are hosted at [ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/tree/gh-pages/test_summaries](https://github.com/ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/tree/gh-pages/test_summaries). 
The [test_bioimageio_resources.yaml](https://github.com/ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/blob/main/.github/workflows/test_bioimageio_resources.yaml) is regularly dispatched by @bioimageiobot to keep test summaries up-to-date.

```yaml
id: ilastik
repository: ilastik/bioimage-io-resources
branch: main
collection_file_name: collection.yaml
test_summaries:
  repository: ilastik/bioimage-io-resources
  deploy_branch: gh-pages
  deploy_folder: test_summaries
  workflow: test_bioimageio_resources.yaml
  workflow_ref: refs/heads/main
```

The test summaries are expected to follow the folder/file name pattern "<resource_id>/<version_id>/test_summary_*.yaml", where * can be any string to differentiate different test settings.

#### Display of partner test summaries

Once a community partner is registered to contribute test summaries with the `test_summaries` data explained above, the main [RI-SCALE Model Hub CI](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/main/.github/workflows/auto_update_main.yaml) collects these summaries. The collection including these collected test summaries are displayed on modelhub.riscale.eu. Currently test summaries are rendered like so:

#### Updating test summaries

The main [RI-SCALE Model Hub CI](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/main/.github/workflows/auto_update_main.yaml) triggers the partner's CI for new or updated resources.
Additionally, the parter may decide at any time to rerun (some of) their tests if changes on their side (like a new version release of their software) requires additional tests or a reevaluation.
